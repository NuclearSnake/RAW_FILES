# RAW_FILES

Files for a QR-based game that is played with a phone, a set of QR codes placed here and there, and a lot of fun. It involves text, audio files, images. On start app scans a QR code telling which file to load as a current quest. And then scanning QR codes leads to different things depending on the quest scanned. You search for QRs, "use" them on each other (like a potion on a dying mage), "grab" them to your inventory, "fight" them and "talk" to them.
